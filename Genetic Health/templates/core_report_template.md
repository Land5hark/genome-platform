# DNA Decoder: Core Report

**Your Personalized Genetic Wellness Guide**

---

## Executive Summary

Welcome to your DNA Decoder Core Report. This report translates {snps_analyzed} genetic variants from your raw data into actionable wellness insights about how your body may respond to foods, supplements, medications, and lifestyle factors.

**What's Inside:**
- {lifestyle_findings_count} lifestyle and wellness insights
- {pharma_findings_count} medication response notes
- Evidence-based action experiments
- Personalized supplement considerations

**What This Report Covers:**
This Core Report focuses on wellness genetics and medication response—the areas where you can take action today. We analyze variants related to nutrition, metabolism, detoxification, sleep, and how your body processes common medications.

**What This Report Doesn't Cover:**
Clinical-grade disease risk screening requires separate analysis. If you're interested in exploring variants that may warrant confirmatory testing with a healthcare provider, that's available in the optional Deep Dive Clinical Context Report.

**Important Context:**
- This analysis is educational, not diagnostic
- Based on direct-to-consumer raw data (not clinical-grade sequencing)
- Many findings have emerging or limited evidence
- Always discuss significant changes with your healthcare provider

## 💊 Medication Response Quick Card

**Share this section with your prescriber when discussing medications**

Your genetic variants may influence how you metabolize certain medications. This is informational only—never change medications without medical supervision.

{pharma_quick_table}

**Evidence Levels:**
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Strong clinical evidence (FDA recognized or major guidelines)
- ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate evidence (replicated studies)
- ⭐⭐ Emerging evidence (preliminary research)

**Next Steps:**
- Bring this to your doctor or pharmacist
- Ask if pharmacogenomic testing is recommended
- Request a medication review if you're taking any flagged drugs

## 🧪 Supplement Considerations

**Before starting any supplement, discuss with your healthcare provider.**

Based on your genetic patterns, these may be worth exploring with medical guidance:

{supplement_suggestions_table}

**Important:**
- These are considerations, not prescriptions
- Quality and dosing matter—work with a practitioner
- Some supplements interact with medications
- Track your response and adjust accordingly

## 📊 Confidence & Limitations

### What This Analysis Can Tell You
- Common genetic variants present in your raw data
- Research-backed associations between variants and traits
- Medication metabolism patterns recognized by pharmacogenomics

### What This Analysis Cannot Tell You
- Clinical diagnoses (that requires a doctor)
- Rare or complex genetic conditions (requires clinical sequencing)
- Exact quantified risk (genetics is one of many factors)
- What will definitely happen (genes aren't destiny)

### Data Quality Notes
- **SNPs Analyzed:** {snps_analyzed}
- **Coverage:** Direct-to-consumer raw data covers common variants but misses rare mutations
- **Confirmation:** High-priority findings should be confirmed with clinical-grade testing
- **Context Matters:** Diet, lifestyle, environment, and other genes all influence outcomes

### How to Use This Report
1. **Read for patterns, not panic.** These are tendencies, not certainties.
2. **Start small.** Pick 1-2 action experiments to try first.
3. **Track your response.** Your body's feedback is the ultimate guide.
4. **Consult professionals.** Share relevant sections with your healthcare team.
5. **Stay curious.** Genetics research is rapidly evolving.
