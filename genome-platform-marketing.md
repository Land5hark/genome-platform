# Marketing Strategy — Genome Intelligence Platform

## Refined Positioning (from Ryan's insight)

### Core Hook
> **"You already paid for your DNA. You just never unlocked it."**

### Target Segment
- **Men 30-50**
- Entrepreneurial mindset
- Already interested in health optimization
- Already bought 23andMe or AncestryDNA
- Disappointed by generic ethnicity reports
- Want actionable health insights, not trivia

### Pain Point
They spent $100+ on a DNA test, got a pie chart showing they're "47% Irish" and a raw data file they can't interpret. The value is trapped. They know there's more in there—but they can't access it.

### The Promise
We extract the health insights they already own but can't see:
- What medications work/fail for their body
- Vitamin deficiencies they're genetically prone to  
- Disease risks they can actually act on
- Personalized supplement protocols

### Messaging Hierarchy

**Primary Headline:**
"Unlock What Your DNA Test Didn't Tell You"

**Secondary:**
"You already paid for your DNA. You just never unlocked it."

**Body:**
"That 23andMe or AncestryDNA report gave you ancestry and raw data. We give you the health blueprint your doctor doesn't have time to explain."

### Key Differentiators
1. **Not another test** — Uses data they already have
2. **Actionable, not academic** — Plain English, not genetic jargon
3. **Clinically grounded** — Based on ClinVar, PharmGKB, peer-reviewed science
4. **Privacy-first** — We don't sell data, we don't store raw files longer than processing

### Call-to-Action Evolution
❌ Old: "Upload Your DNA Data"
✅ New: "Unlock Your DNA"

❌ Old: "Get Comprehensive Reports"
✅ New: "See What You're Missing"

### Risk Reversal
"See your top 3 health insights free. Pay only if you want the full picture."

### Visual Direction
- Masculine but sophisticated (not clinical, not woo-woo)
- Dark mode default (but light mode available)
- Data visualization that looks like a premium health dashboard
- Trust signals: "Bank-level encryption," "Used by 10,000+ biohackers"

### Channel Strategy
1. **Twitter/X** — Thread: "I paid $100 for 23andMe/Ancestry and got a PDF. Then I unlocked the real value..."
2. **Reddit** — r/biohacking, r/Supplements: "Here's what my DNA actually means for my supplement stack"
3. **YouTube** — "What 23andMe & Ancestry won't tell you about your health"
4. **Podcasts** — Health optimization shows, entrepreneur podcasts
5. **Email** — Lead magnet: "The 5 genetic variants every man should know"

### Pricing Psychology
- Free tier = Proof of concept (they see we deliver)
- $79 = No-brainer (less than the DNA test itself)
- $199 = Premium positioning (less than one doctor visit)

### Objection Handling
**"Is this medical advice?"**
"No—this is educational information about your genetics. Always consult your doctor before making health changes."

**"Is my data safe?"**
"Your raw DNA file is deleted after analysis. We never sell data. Reports are encrypted and only you can access them."

**"What if I don't have 23andMe?"**
"Works with AncestryDNA, MyHeritage, or any service that exports raw data. Full genome sequencing coming soon."
